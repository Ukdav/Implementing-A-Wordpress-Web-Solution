# Implementing-A-Wordpress-Web-Solution-With-LVM-Storage-Mgt

A WordPress web solution with LVM (Logical Volume Management) storage management offers increased flexibility, scalability, and reliability for your website. LVM allows you to efficiently manage disk space, making adapting to changing storage needs easier. Here's a short note on how to implement this solution:

Prerequisites:

**A Linux server:** Choose a Linux distribution of your preference (e.g., Ubuntu or CentOS) and ensure it is up and running.

**LVM installed:** You must make sure the LVM package is installed on your server.

## STEP1 Preparing Web Server

* Create an EC2 instance server on AWS

* On the EBS console, create (3) three storage volumes for the instance. This serves as additional external storage to our EC2 machine
